\title{Connect five points into three triangles}
\usage{
connect_five_points(points)
}
\arguments{
\item{points}{A matrix with exactly five rows (x and y coordinates).}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
\describe{
\item{points}{The original points (matrix).}
\item{edges}{A matrix of edges (each row is a pair of point indices forming an edge).}
}
}
\description{
This function demonstrates a simple approach to connect five 2D points
into a set of three triangles. For demonstration purposes only: the triangles
here are formed by a fixed (toy) example.
}
\examples{
data("sample_points")
result <- connect_five_points(sample_points)
print(result)
